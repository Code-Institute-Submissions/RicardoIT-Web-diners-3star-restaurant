# UX

## Purpose
----
This project was developed to satisfy my fourth Milestone Project for the full stack development program with [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net). For this project I have decided to create an imaginary beautiful 3star Michelin restaurant serving customers staying at the nearby beach Hotel. The restaurant allows customers to prebook meals with the added feature of allowing customers to select between three locations within the restaurant, these being outside, window seat or in the main hall areas. This current release will be restricted to a maximum of 2 tables outside sitting 2 people on each table. 2 window tables each sitting a maximum of 4 people on each table and 2 hall tables each sitting a maximum of 6 people on each table.

The restaurant prides itself in providing their customers with a more inclusive experience by allowing customers to visit the kitchen area, speak to the chef and their team and be able to have a little taste of any Menu meal before ordering.


## Project Scoping and Agile Methodology

Using the Design Thinking approach to this project, some prework was carried out to bring the ideas and functionality of the project to "paper". Powerpoint slides are used to illustrate this process beggining with a problem statement, the slides also include Entity Relationship diagrams and map os how all epics link to their respective User Stories. Each User Story will include steps that aim to fulfill the CRUD (create-read-update-delete) functionalities expected with any database application.

The raw data can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/RicardoIT-Web/diners-3star-restaurant/blob/main/media/agile_methodology/Diners-3Star-Restaurant_project_Scoping.pptx).


## Wireframes 
This project is created using Bootstrap and Django frameworks. The built in tools for these frameworks already assist with site responsiveness, as a result, a Desktop approach first was adopted with the aim that responsive adjustments would be minor and is applied at the end of the projects' full creation.

Wireframes are created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAubmPBhCyARIsAJWNpiMYzrk_0rLzl3vgYKRLXwnX7rpqyQiUFdyt3xHGpRiHlZlozwO_pvcaAvUFEALw_wcB). 

The project was developed from initial wireframes and some modifications were made during the development process to ensure better UX.


#### The Home page
Where some sites demontrate some django functionality on the landing page ie. the home page, for this project, the landing page shows the basic features one would expect to see for a restaurant site. The User is greeted with a main hero image, together with a Navbar and footer to guide the user to other features of the site, which covers some of the User Stories listed below.

![Home page](/media/wireframes/homepage_wf.jpg)

![Offcanvas Navbar](/media/wireframes/offcanvas_navbar_wf.jpg)


#### The Register page
The registration page is designed to be light on the eyes to the User. There are 3 cards above the registration form which aim to remind the customers of the speacial services available to them should they wish to take advantage.

![Register page](/media/wireframes/register_page_wf.jpg)


#### The Login page
The login page initially looked bare and was missing a little something with just the Login form for the User to fill in. At this point it was decided the a hero image in the background would improve this UX.

![Login page](/media/wireframes/login_page_wf.jpg)


#### The Menu page
After carrying out some research into this Menu section, it was found that a lot of restaurants actually have fixed, unchanged menus. As a result it was decided that this restaurant would have a fixed unchanged menu for this first release. In future releases of this project the administrator will have control of this functionality and will be able to make changes to the Menu of the restaurant.

## User Stories

In order to demonstrate an Agile approach to this project, GitHub issues were used as a Kanban board to record the user stories. The user stories were categorised into different User functions between the Admin and the User and each issue would be moved from the "to-do" board to the "done" board as the project progressed.

### User stories - Admin features
The following user stories were satisfied by the creation of the Restaurant app, which include these features:


[User Story #1](https://github.com/RicardoIT-Web/diners-3star-restaurant/issues/1) As a administrator I can click on the navbar and select "login" so that I can make a booking on behalf of a customer.

[User Story #2](https://github.com/RicardoIT-Web/diners-3star-restaurant/issues/2) As a administrator I can view pending customer bookings so that I can approve or reject reservation requests.

[User Story #3](https://github.com/RicardoIT-Web/diners-3star-restaurant/issues/3) As a administrator I can view User Contact details so that I can reach out to them regarding their booking requests.

# Backend Features

This project is built using Django, adopting the MVT (Models-Views-Templates) methodology. The restaurant app which contains the MVT architechture to make this site interactive has three main models:

### The Table Model

The Table model is created to provide the restaurant with a more flexible approach of managing tables pending customer demand. This feature is only available to the restaurant administrator. As an example, in the winter months the outside tables might be moved indoors as the demand for outdoor space might be reduced or eliminated. This model provides an administrator with the functionality to be able to do just that.

#### The Admin View

Employing all CRUD features - The administrator can Create, Read, Update and Delete any of these tables.
![The Table Model](/media/images/table_management_admin_img.jpg)


### The Booking Model

The booking model allows both the site administrator and the User to make a booking. The booking form requires that a table is selected, the number of guests attending, the date of the reservation, a start time and an end time. The form also contains a comments section to allow both the admin and the User to provide any comments such as any dietry restriction or perhaps raise any questions.

#### Admin view

Employing all CRUD features - The administrator can Create, Read, Update and Delete any of the bookings.
![The Booking Model](/media/images/admin_booking_form.jpg)

### The Contact Model

The contact model allows the User to fill in a form and raise any queries. The Admin might receive a call and can use this form to keep a record of any queries riased. The data is "posted" to the PostgreSQL tabale. This in turn allows that data to be accessed by the administrator to act and respond to the User regarding any queries or suggestions. The admin view comes with an added feature of "Actioned" status to allow the restaurant to track opened and closed enquiries.

# Frontend Features

There are of course other features on this site that would be expected. The site contains an offcanvas navigation panel provided with the assistance of Bootstrap5, which holds repeated links as seen on the top navbar of the main page view, but also contains links to the following items:

* The Menu page
* The Contacts Page
* The Booking page
* The Social Media accounts
* Confirmation of Booking received
* Alert message of unavailable table.

The main navbar and the offcanvas navigation is available to the User at all times.

![Offcanvas Navbar](/media/images/offcanvas_navbar_img.jpg)

### The Menu Page

The Menu page will satisfy User Story #5, as referenced in the User stories section above. The User is able to click on the link and is directed to the Menu page which is an image of a fixed Menu which for this first release will not be changeable.

![The Menu Page](/media/images/menu_pg.jpg)

### The Contacts Page

The contacts page satisfies User Story #6 and contains a simple form for the User to be able to reach out to the restaurant for answers to any queries or even to make and suggestions. The User can contact the restaurant via the provided form, or the page contains address details and contact phone number as alternative options. The map feature on the page is just a simple map illustrating the location of the restaurant. Should the User opt to call the restaurant, the administrator also has access to a contact form in the admin environment allowing the restaurant to keep a record of any external enquiries as detailed above.

#### The User View

#### The Admin View

![The Contacts Page](/media/images/user_contact_form_admin_view.jpg)

### The Booking Page

The booking page completes User Story #10 and allows a User to make a reservation at the restaurant. If the User is not authenticated, when they click on the bookings link they will be met with a message stating that they must be logged in if they wish to make a reservation. This feature does provide the User with an alternative which they can opt to select, this alternative takes them to the contacts form where they can raise a request and the restaurant will make the reservation on their behalf.

#### The Booking Message

![Not Authenticated Booking Message](/media/images/not_authenticated_user_booking_page.jpg)

#### The Alternative message

![Not Authenticated Alternative Message](/media/images/not_authenticated_user_booking_page_alt_message.jpg)

### The Social Media Accounts

The social media account links allow the Users to find out more about what other updates and activities the restaurant are involved in. By selecting one of these, the respective accounts will open up on a new tab.

# Bugs During Development

During the development phase of this project, Heroku made serveral updates to every app in my account. At some point, my static files stopped connecting to the heroku app meaning I was able to view my project in deployed view but it was missing a lot of CSS styiling.

To fix this with the support of the tutors at CI I went through the following steps;

* Access Heroku using the terminal

![Access Heroku - terminal](/media/images/dugs_heroku_staticfiles.jpg)

* Enter your email
    * For the password, go into your cloudinary profile and copy the API key
    * paste API key in terminal password

![Access Heroku - terminal](/media/images/dugs_heroku_staticfiles3.jpg)

* Once login confirmed
    * in the terminal type heroku run python manage.py collectstatic -a diners-3star-restaurant
    * you will be prompted to confirm Y or N

![Access Heroku - terminal](/media/images/dugs_heroku_staticfiles5.jpg)

* Once I selected Y the problem was fixed and the static files were now being copied to Heroku


# Deployment

### Heroku

* Create an account with Heroku if you dont already have one. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) www.heroku.com

## Installing Project Requirements

### In the terminal

* Install Postgresql: "pip3 install psycopg2-binary". Postgres is a way for the content to link to the database on the backend.
* Install Webserver: "pip3 install gunicorn". This replaces the development server once the app is deployed to Heroku.
* Create a requirements file: "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt". This creates a file to let heroku know which packages to install.

### In Heroku

* Open the Resources Tab
* Add Postgres to your app using search bar, select - Heroku Postgres
* Select Hobby Dev
* Open  the settings tab
* Click Reveal Config Vars - Heroku creates a Database_url variable
* Install a database url package: "pip3 install dj-database-url". This package allows us to parse the database url that Heroku created.
* Refreeze the requirements file: "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt".
* Get the url of the remote database: "heroku config". This displays the DATABASE URL FROM HEROKU in the terminal - Copy this value

### Django > settings.py

* Comment out the original DATABASE settings.
* Copy and Paste the DATABASE settings: "DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse('postgres://DATABASE URL FROM HEROKU')}"
* Import dj_database_url: "import dj_database_url". Import at top of settings.py.

### Back to the terminal

* Run migrations: "python3 manage.py migrate".
    * (If you get the error below while following these videos:django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL: role "somerandomletters" does not exist)
    * Please run the following command in the terminal to fix it:(unset PGHOSTADDR)

### In Gitpod

* If you are not using the CI full template - Create a new file, .gitignore: django_todo / .gitignore. Lists any files we don’t want to include in the Github Repository.

### Back to the terminal

* Add your files to the local git repo: git add .
* Commit the files.
* Push to remote repo.

### In Gitpod

* Create a new file: Procfile
    * Add gunicorn to Procfile - web: gunicorn django_todo.wsgi:application

### Back to the terminal

* Add the Procfile to the git Repo - git add Procfile
* Git Commit / push

### In heroku / settings tab

* Click Open App

### In the Browser

* Copy the url

### Django > In settings.py

* Paste in the url to ALLOWED_HOSTS value - ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['diners-3star-restaurant.herokuapp.com'] - Make sure to delete the Https structure at the start of the url & the final ‘/’

### In the Terminal

* Add settings.py file to gitpod repo - git add django_todo/settings.py
* git commit -m “Fixed Allowed_hosts”
* git push

### Django > In settings.py

* Add import os to settings.py
    * import os
* Git add, commit and push your repo to github once you have done this.

### Back to Heroku

* Open your app
* Open the Deploy Tab
* Select a Deployment Method Option - Github - Connect to Github
* Search for the Repo Name
* Click Connect
* Enable Automatic Deploys

### Django > In settings.py

* Get the Secret Key value using an environment variable
    * SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '---secretkeyvalue---’)
* Replace the Heroku host value in ALLOWED_HOSTS - ALLOWED_HOSTS = [os.environ.get('diners-3star-restaurant.herokuapp.com')]
* Replace the Database URL value in DATABASES - 
    * DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }

### Back to Heroku

* Click the Settings tab
* Click Reveal Config Vars
* Add New Variable

* Wait for the Repo to deploy to Heroku
* Refresh the herokuapp in the browser
* The app should now be working
